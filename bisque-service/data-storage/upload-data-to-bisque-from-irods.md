# iRODS Storage Service

BisQue2 hosts an [iRODS](https://github.com/irods/irods) instance which allows you to manage your BisQue2 data from the command line (rather than through the browser). Each BisQue2 account has a corresponding iRODS account, meaning that your username and password for BisQue2 is the same for iRODS. Storing your data on iRODS is very simple and offers the following benefits:

1. Sync your local directory with an iRODS collection
2.  Parallel upload large files
3.  Write shell scripts to manipulate your BisQue data

Getting started with iRODS is made very easy by using [CyVerse's GoCommands](https://github.com/cyverse/gocommands) command line tool.
